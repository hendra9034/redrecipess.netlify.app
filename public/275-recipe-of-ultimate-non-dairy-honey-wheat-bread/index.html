<ol>
<li>Pre-heat oven to 350 °F.  Mix dry ingredients together. I place everything into a dry mixing bowl ( your kitchen aid mixing bowl if you have ) and use a wire whisk to sift everything together nicely.</li>
<li>Put water, salt, honey, sugar, milk and butter in med sauce pan and heat to about 130 °F. - make sure butter is melted and honey is well stirred in.</li>
<li>Use a kitchen aid mixer with dough hook, place mixed dry ingredients in mixing bowl.  - Turn on mixer to the lowest setting and Slowly pour the liquid mixture in while it is mixing.</li>
<li>Let mix on stir for about 2 min, then turn up 1 setting and mix for 2 more min.  - finally, turn back down to stir for about a min.</li>
<li>Carefully remove the dough from the dough hook and plop the dough ball down on a lightly floured  - surface. You are just going to kneed lightly and mostly roll the dough around to get a nice smooth  - ball. Try to keep any seems or folds on one side of the dough so when you place it back in a bowl to rise, only a nice smooth seamless round ball will be showing in your bowl.  - Drop the dough ball into an oiled (the tbs spoon of olive oil) large mixing bowl.  - I always hold the bowl in my hands and try to roll the dough around in the bowl to coat it evenly  - and to try and get oil up on the sides of the bowl where the dough will soon be touching when it rises.</li>
<li>*If you are doing this by hand, I have done both and both turn out just fine. It's Just more work by hand of course.  - Slowly add the liquid as you stir with a large wooden spoon after all the liquid is added, keep stirring until the dough becomes a nice big lump and no more stray chunks of dough are sticking to the sides of the bowl.  - Then turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 7-10 min.  - try not to ?stretch and tear? the dough as you knead, you want to fold it back and forth from one hand to the other like your folding taffy. - right hand moves the dough in toward you, then the left hand moves the dough in toward you, then roll it out away from you a bit and do it again.

Knead a little more until you can get a nice seamless ball. - Keep the seams all at the bottom, then when you place it into your oiled bowl to rise, (the tbsp spoon of olive oil) you will see a nice smooth ball of dough rising. Make su</li>
<li>Cover with a towel and let sit for about an hour in a warm place. Be careful that its not to warm.   - I always place on-top of a pot that is sitting in the middle of my oven that is preheating. So I have my dough bowl sitting on top of a pot with no lid, just to keep it of the surface of the oven so its doesn't get to hot, but it seems to keep it nice and warm. I also use a warm damp towel to cover it, that seems to work out well. But use whatever you have, just as long as you cover it and place it in a warm place.</li>

Usually the leftover oil from the bowl will do,  - but if its to sticky, drop a few more drops of olive oil onto your surface.  -  You are just going to roll the dough around for about a min. you want to try and keep any seems on one side also because thats the side that you will place down in your bread pans.  - If you roll and or knead to much, the bread turns out more dense and less airy. You want to have nice tiny little air pockets though, not big giant holes, so rolling around should be good to remove the big air pockets.</li>
<li>Oil 2 bread pans. You can use whatever oil you like. I use spray oil to coat evenly.</li>
<li>Roll the dough out into 1 fat log of dough.  Place your bread pans in front of the roll to measure where - you will cut the log in half. Because you will cut this log in half now to share between the two.  -  - Cut into two rolls and try to just tuck the ends of each roll under themselves as you place in the bread pans.</li>
<li>After the dough is in the pans, place the pans back to your warm spot and let rise for about 30 min.  - I leave mine uncovered to rise because my spot is really warm, you may want to cover. If you do cover, use something light so that when the dough rises, it doesn't have to push up against the weight of the towel your  using. Also, don't let rise to long if you do it will sink a little when you bake it.</li>
<li>Carefully place in oven for about 30 min, or until brown. It will be beyond ?golden? brown because the honey/wheat makes it darker.  - Remove and let cool on a rack. Slice and enjoy a great Deli sammich!</li>
