<li>Preparation: coarsely chop the walnuts and roast them in a skillet over low heat until they start making crackling noises.</li>
<li>Place all ingredients except the walnuts into a bread machine, select the dough cycle and press start, allowing the machine to do its job until the first rising. Add the walnuts in the case inside the machine designated for toppings and additions.</li>
<li>When the cycle completes, take the dough out to a working surface, punch it down to let the trapped air out, divide the dough into 4 and roll into balls. Cover the dough with a damp cloth, and let it rest for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Punch down again to let the air out and roll out the dough to 20 cm in length.</li>
<li>Place the dough so the longer side lies sideways. Roll the dough somewhat loosely.</li>
<li>Seal the edges and the seam tightly.</li>
<li>Roll the dough back and forth with your hands, form it into a 25 cm cylinder shape.</li>
<li>Using the bottom of your palm, flatten one of the edges.</li>
<li>Make the dough into a ring, Wrap the end of the dough with the other flattened end made in Step 8. Form to make it into your desired shape.</li>
<li>Let the dough rest again on a parchment lined cookie sheet. It is done when the dough has loosened and puffed up.  It took 30 minutes at 30℃ today.</li>
<li>Preparation during rising; using a large pot that can hold all 4 pieces of dough at once, bring water to a boil. About 80℃, when small bubbles begin to form at the edge of the pot, would be the ideal temperature.</li>
<li>Place a piece of paper towel on the working surface for draining the dough right after boiling. Preheat oven to 220℃.</li>

<li>When boiling is done, place it onto the prepared paper towel, and lightly wipe off the excess water.</li>
<li>Reduce the oven temperature to 200℃, bake the dough for 15～17 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
