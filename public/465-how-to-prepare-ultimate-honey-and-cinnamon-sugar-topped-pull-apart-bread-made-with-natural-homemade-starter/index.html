<ol>
<li>Mix the floury ingredients together with a whisk. Measure out the milk and water in a measuring cup. Add the honey to the liquid and mix well to dissolve.</li>
<li>Put all the ingredients except for the shortening and butter in a bowl, and mix together until it's no longer floury. Knead with a bread machine or mixer for 15 minutes. When the dough forms a gluten film (the dough can be stretched out to a thin translucent sheet of gluten) stop kneading.</li>
<li>Divide the dough using a pastry cutter into about 10 pieces. Return to the mixer or bread machine, add the butter and shortening, and knead for another 10 minutes. When a gluten film forms again, take the dough out.</li>
<li>Form into a ball with a smooth, taut surface. Put the dough in a plastic bag or container, and leave to rise overnight at room temperature, until it's 2 to 2.5 times its original volume. (The rising time varies depending on the temperature of the room.)</li>
<li>If you leave it in a cool place near a window,for example, it will take about 10 hours. In a warm place it will rise faster. You can adjust the time by putting the dough the refrigerator.</li>
<li>The next morning, deflate the dough by folding it, and divide into 16 pieces. Round off each portion into a smooth ball. Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>After the dough has rested, press down to deflate and round off each piece into a smooth ball again, sealing the edges tightly. LIne up the dough in an oiled square baking pan.</li>
<li>Use your oven's bread-rising setting to conduct the 2nd rising for 1-2 hours at 30°C. Leave the dough to rise until the tops are about 1 cm below the rim of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap or a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel to prevent the dough from drying out.</li>
<li>When the dough has finished rising, preheat the oven to 190°C. Mix the sugar and cinnamon powder together to make cinnamon sugar.</li>
<li>Melt the butter (over hot water or in the microwave), and brush it evenly over the dough. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the dough generously.</li>
<li>Bake for about 18 minutes in a preheated 190°C oven. If it looks like the bread is browning too fast, cover with a piece of foil.</li>
<li>When the bread is baked, drop the pan onto your countertop from about a 30 cm height to force the steam out. Take the bread out of the pan and cool on a rack.</li>
<li>Here I covered half the loaf with plain granulated sugar, and the other half with cinnamon sugar.</li>
<li>To fully enjoy the crunchy sugar top, it's best to eat this when it's fresh out of the oven, or just cooled. If you cover the top with plastic, the plastic will stick to the sugar. (See Hints.)</li>
<li>Here I made a version using a whole wheat sponger starter. I made this on a warm day in May; the dough was left to rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature, then for 5-6 hours in the refrigerator, and it was just about right. As a reference.</li>
<li>The bread looks like this when pulled apart. Light and silky-smooth and chew. Yummy!</li>
