<li>NOTE: Some will want to know if they can cut calories and fat by substituting for the butter, cream, whole milk, eggs. Simple answer, NO.

<li>Tear the bread into 1-inch pieces and place in a very large bowl.</li>
<li>Grease a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with the butter and set aside.</li>
<li>Combine the heavy cream, milk, eggs, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk to mix. Stir in the raisins and pecan pieces.</li>
<li>Pour the cream mixture over the bread, and stir to combine. The spices tend to stick to the bowl, so be sure to scrape all the spices into the bowl of bread too. Allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for 1 hour so most of the cream mixture is absorbed by the bread.</li>
<li>Carefully pour the bread mixture into the buttered baking dish and bake in a 350° F oven until the center of the bread pudding is set, about 1 hour. While it's baking, prepare the whiskey sauce.</li>
<li>In a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream, milk, and sugar.</li>
