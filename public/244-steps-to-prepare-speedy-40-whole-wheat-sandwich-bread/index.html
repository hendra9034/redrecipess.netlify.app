<ol>
<li>★Recipe video★ (my You Tube channel)→https://youtu.be/Avcswv_OwAw</li>
<li>Press the butter to soften a little; set aside. Warm the water-milk mixture with a microwave until reaches 35-40℃ / 95-104 °F. (If the room temperature is high, around 20°C / 68°F.)</li>
<li>Put bread flour, whole wheat flour, cane sugar, and instant dry yeast in a large bowl. Pour 80％ of the water-milk mixture into the bowl like drawing circles. Mix roughly.</li>
<li>Pour the remaining water mixture against powdery places. Mix roughly until it becomes a single mass. Put onto a work surface.</li>
<li>Knead for a min, flatten it and put salt on. Knead it for 2-3 mins while stretching and pressing until combined.</li>
<li>Hit the dough against the work surface and fold, repeat 30 times. Roll it alternate left and right (1 set), repeat 30 sets. Repeat 30-hitting and 30-rolling alternately for 7-8 mins.</li>
<li>Flatten and spread it, put unsalted butter on. Knead well with your hands until combined for around 2-3 mins while pressing and stretching.</li>
<li>Repeat hitting and rolling for 7-8 mins in the same way as before. Please make the dough smooth and elastic. Make it the ball shape.</li>
<li>Place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let it rise in a warm place (about 35℃ / 95°F) until doubled in size, 40-50 mins.</li>
<li>Finger Dent Test! Press your floured finger into the dough. If the dent springs back a little, and it stays without filling in, it’s ready.</li>
<li>Punch the air out. Divide it into 2 equal pieces.</li>
<li>Using your hand to flatten one piece into a rough rectangle. Start to roll from one of the shorter ends and roll it up into a cylinder. Rotate it 90 degrees and roll it up with the seam side facing up. Repeat with another piece.</li>
<li>Cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 10-15 mins. (After 10-15 mins, it's will rise a little.)</li>
<li>Punch the air out. Use a rolling pin to roll out one piece into about 15 x 25 cm (5.9 × 9.8 inches) oval or rectangular.</li>
<li>Fold it towards the center from left and right to overlap about 1 cm (0.4-inch). Start to roll from one of the shorter ends and roll it up. Pinch the edges to seal well. Repeat with another piece.</li>
<li>Place each dough at both ends of a lightly oiled pan with the seam side facing down. Let it rise in a warm place (about 40℃ / 104°F) until the top of the dough reach the height of the loaf pan, about 30-40 mins. Preheat the oven to 220℃ / 428°F.</li>
<li>I used my oven to rise the dough until the top of the dough reach the height of the loaf pan. The dough needs to rise a little more, but the oven cannot be used for rising because the oven needs preheating. So I put the pan on the container with warm water to rise until the top of the dough is higher 1 cm (0.4'') than the height of the pan. - Lightly cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying.</li>
<li>Spray water lightly (about 3 times). Bake it at 200℃ / 392 °F for 30 mins until golden brown.</li>
<li>Drop the pan to prevent shrinkage. Remove the bread from the pan and cool it down on a rack. Done!</li>
