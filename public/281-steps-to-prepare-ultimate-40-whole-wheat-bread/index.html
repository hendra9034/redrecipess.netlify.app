<p>40% whole wheat bread. is one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions daily. 40% whole wheat bread. is something that I have loved my whole life. They are fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>Using whole-wheat automatically means that the dough will contain less gluten. I decided to add eight &quot;turns&quot; (stretching the dough and folding it over on itself) during Recent Posts. This weekend the overnight whole wheat bread took hold of my kitchen. Like the last entry for the overnight white, this was a variation on the theme of overnight fermentation.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have 40% whole wheat bread. using 6 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<ol>
<li>Get 200 grams Whole wheat flour.</li>
<li>Get 300 grams White wheat flour.</li>
<li>Take 400 grams Water 90-95°F (32-35°C)</li>
<li>Make ready 1 bunch Optional ingredients (seeds, bran, flakes etc)</li>
<li>Prepare 2 1/2 grams Instant yeast (dry).</li>
<li>Take 12 grams Fine sea salt.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know what they do, but the breads are just too sweet tasting and generally have an odd after taste. Source: Nutrient data for this listing was. A simple four ingredient whole wheat sourdough bread, made with purely whole grain flour. It's a delicious, flavourful, and wholesome loaf!</p>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-40-whole-wheat-bread">Steps to make 40% whole wheat bread.:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Autolyse. Mix flours with lukewarm water, to the point of fully incorporated &amp; no longer dry flour is visible. Cover and let it sit in room temperature, for 20-30min.</li>
<li>Mixing. Prepare other bowl with warm water (that's for reweting your hand). Sprinkle salt, yeast and/or optional ingredients. Grab the dough from the bottom and fold on the top. Repeat it 4-5 times. Use your thumb &amp; forefinger to 'pince' the dough inbetween folds. Rewet hand when needed.</li>
<li>Folding. Set the timer for 5 hrs. It's best to fold the dough 3-4 times, during first 2 hrs of fermentation (for ex. every half hour). Grab from the bottom,  stretch but not too much,  and fold over the top. This step doesn't require 'pinching'. Only 3-4 folds at a time. That serves for building 'structure/foundation' for gluten. By the 3 or 4 fold you'll notice that dough has stiffened and has some gas (CO2) inside. That's good :)</li>
<li>Dividing.  That's an optional step. Follow it only when you have enough dough for 2 or more loafs (this recipe can be scaled up if you have bigger family :)) Sprinkle some flour on your working surface,  flour your hands to easily handle the dough. Tip it on the surface, and divide on equal parts, using plastic scraper or dough knife.</li>
<li>Shaping &amp; proofing. By the end of those 5 hrs, dough at least should double (or even triple) its original volume. Shape the dough in way that seams will be facing the bottom. Sprinkle some flour on the top, cover and let it proof for approx. 60-75 min (it depends of your ambient temperature, if warmer - shorter proofing time would be needed). Finger dent test after 1 hr. If dough after poking springs back quickly = some more time is needed. If springs back slowly and not completely = fully proofed and ready for baking. If doesn't spring back = over proofed (but good to go as well :))</li>
<li>Preheating. Before end of proofing time (15-20 min), set your oven for 475°F (245°C). Put inside the dutch oven or other heat resistant vessel with lid on.</li>
<li>Baking. Using antiheat mitts, take out dutch oven &amp; lid off. Very gently and carefully (heat!!! ) transfer your prooven dough to the dutch oven (using edges of your palms, not fingers). Cover and bake in the middle of the oven for 30 min, maintaining 475°F (245°C). After that time, take the lid off and bake for another approx. 15-20 min (it's a crust formation phase).</li>
<li>After bake is done. Again, wearing mitts, take the loaf out and let it cool on some rack or even tilted on one side (better air circulation around). It's cooled enough after 20 min. Enjoy fruit of you labor :)</li>
