recipeinstructions:
- "Start by combining the yeast and sugar in a small bowl. Add the water while gently stirring the yeast and sugar. Let the mixture sit while you mix the rest of the ingredients -- bubbles and foam should form if the yeast is active."
- "Combine the flour mix, xanthum gum and slt in the largest mixing bowl and stir well."
- "In  third bowl, whisk the eggs, oil and vinegar until the eggs are a bit frothy."
- "By this point the yeast mixture should be foamy, so you can pour the two liquid mixtures into the flour mixture. Blend the dough with a mixer for 4 minutes.  CAN USE BREAD MACHINE DIRECTIONS HERE."

- "Bake at 375°F for 50-60 minutes."
- "BREAD MACHINE DIRECTIONS;  Scoop your dough into the bread machine and smooth the top of the dough. I bake my bread using an 80 minute setting that allows for 20 minutes of kneading, 18 minutes of rise, and 42 minutes of baking. However, since I don&#39;t use the paddle in by bread machine, Im effectively ding a 38 minute rise and a 42 minute bake.
