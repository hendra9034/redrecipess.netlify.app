recipeingredient:
- "1 1/2 cup warm water around 100f no higher than 115f"
- "1 Tbs active dry yeast"
- "2 tsp Kosher Salt"
- "1 1/2 Tbs olive oil"
- "500 g AP White Flour about 3 12 Cups"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add water to a stand mixer with a dough hook, the yeast, sugar, and salt. Let sit for the yeast to soften or foam. I usually just mix it in the dry ingredients as I&#39;ve never had yeast fail. That was in the old days with the yeast cubes that some still use."
- "Add 350g (flour 2 1/2 cups) flour and mix at medium speed for 2 minutes."
- "Reduce speed and add 150g (1 cup) flour a little at a time."
- "Adjust flourer for a soft dough that doesn&#39;t stick to the bowl."
- "Remove and form into a ball, put into a large greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until double, about an hour."
- "At this point, I cut the dough in half, wrap in greased plastic and freeze for another time. I use the other half for todays bread."
- "For a full recipe, cut the dough in half and form each into two loaves."
- "Either put them on parchment paper on a peel or sprinkle cornmeal on a cookie sheet. Or, if you&#39;re brave, sprinkle the peel with cornmeal to slide the dough."
- "If using a stone, preheat the oven to 375f for 45 minutes."
- "Cover and allow to rise until about double."
- "Without a stone: Preheat the oven to 400f about 15 minutes before baking."
- "Make 3-4 shallow slits in the top of the dough with a serated knife or razor blade. This keeps it from splitting when cooked."
- "On a stone: Gently slide the dough onto the stone and bake for 40 minutes until lightly brown and hollow sounding."
- "Without a stone: Put the pan in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes until lightly brown and hollow sounding."
- "Cool on a rack and serve or wrap in plastic rap."
