- "1 can Hunts Pasta Sauce 24 oz Red Sauce"
- "1 can Rag Alfredo sauce 16 oz White Sauce"
- "1 tb spoon of Parsley"
- "16 oz Ricotta cheese"
- "1/2 cup Parmesan cheese"
- "1 cup shredded MexicanFiesta blend cheese"
- "6 eggs"
- "2 tb spoons Italian seasoning"
- " Bread Crumbs Italian Style"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix Ricotta, Parmesan, Mixed cheese, parsley &amp; Italian seasoning in a bowl to make a thick paste."
- "Pre-heat oven to 300 degrees for later. Boil lasagna noodles according to the box instructions. Once cooked, lay out noodles and allow 2 mins to cool."
- "Once cooled, spread a small layer of cheese filling along the noodles. You will be folding/rolling the noodles, make sure it’s a thin layer, they will be thick, I promise."
- "After covering, I folded the noodles 3 times, I’mein not talented enough to roll them. The cheese will act as an adhesive to allow the noodles to keep shape. When you’ve folded/rolled your noodles, stand them on their side on a tray and stick them in the freezer to set for 60 mins(1 hour)"
- "After the hour they should be stiff and should not come undone. Using the remaining 4 eggs, whisk them together. Dip the lasagna noodles and then cover them in the breading. This won’t crisp a lot, but it’ll add a subtle crunch."
- "Once breaded place in air fryer leaving enough space so noodles aren’t touching. Cook at 400 degrees for 10 mins."
- "While noodles are frying, add Ragú sauce to a oven safe dish and “bake” at 300 degrees for the duration of the frying noodles. Pour red sauce into a sauce pan to a simmer."
- "When air fryer has finished cooking the noodles, place the noodles in the pan with the white sauce standing up. Pour red sauce over noodles and serve. I added a little more cheese, don’t judge, and it turned out delicious"
