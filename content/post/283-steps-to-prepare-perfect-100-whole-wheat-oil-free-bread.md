recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Whole wheat bread strong flour"
- "20 grams Sugar"
- "3 grams Salt"
- "3 grams Dry yeast"
- "160 ml Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add all of the ingredients to your bread maker at home and switch it onto the dough course until it gets to the first proving stage."
- "Take the dough out of the bread maker, punch it down and split into 2 equal halves. Shape the halves into balls and leave to rest under a damp cloth for 15 minutes."
- "Lightly punch out the gas again, and with a rolling pin, roll the dough out into an oblong, elliptical shape."
- "Fold the dough in half over the vertical axis and roll up. Make sure the seam is sealed up tightly."
- "Place the rolls seam side down inside a lightly oiled loaf tin. Leave to prove for a second time at 40°C until the dough takes up half of the tin (this should take around 90 minutes)."
- "This is what it should look like after the second proving."
- "Bake for 20-25 minutes in an oven preheated to 200°C. If it looks like the top is going to burn, cover it with aluminium foil."
- "When baked, leave the loaf in the tin and drop it from around 30 cm onto your counter or working surface. Remove the bread from the tin as early as possible."
- "My Proving Method Fill a frying pan with 42°C warm water and place the loaf tin inside If the water cools down, simply heat it back up."
- "This bread is so soft when just out of the oven. If it cools, you can re-heat it in the microwave."
