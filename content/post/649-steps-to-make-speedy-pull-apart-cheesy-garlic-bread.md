- "Tangzhong: with a wooden spoon, mix flour and water in a pan until there is no lump. Cook over medium-low heat and keep stirring to prevent sticking and burning. Remove from heat when the mixture gets thicker (some lines will show as we stir). Transfer into a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap sticking onto its surface and then set aside to cool."
- "Bread dough: In a stand-mixer&#39;s bowl, combine all dry ingredients. Equip the mixer with a dough hook."
- "In a separate bowl, combine milk, cooled tangzhong and egg. Mix and then add into the dry ingredients."
- "Start mixing at the lowest speed then second speed. Frequently scrape the sides and bottoms of bowl with a silicone spatula. When it starts to become a dough, gradually add cubed butter in."
- "The dough will become very sticky. Mix for about 8 minutes or so. During this mixing process, gradually add flour as much as needed and until the dough feels less sticky to the touch."
- "Finish by kneading the dough on a lightly floured surface. Knead until it is smooth, elastic and not sticky. Round up the dough and place in an oil-greased and large bowl. Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Let sit for 45 minutes or until doubled in size."
- "Filling: simply mix all ingredients until well-combined, except for the cheese."
- "After the dough is doubled in size, punch out the air until it flattens. Transfer it onto a lightly floured surface and roll it into a 12 x 8 inches (30 x 20 cm) rectangle."
- "Spread the butter filling onto the rectangle dough and sprinkle (85g) cheese on top."

- "Let cool on cooling rack for 5 minutes. Then run a silicone spatula along the inner sides of the pan to remove it."
