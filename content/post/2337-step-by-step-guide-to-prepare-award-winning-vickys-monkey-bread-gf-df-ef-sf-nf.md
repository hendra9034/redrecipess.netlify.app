- "Invert onto a serving plate and enjoy. Any leftovers can be frozen for up to 3 months. Just defrost then warm through in the oven at the same temp for 4 minutes to refresh them"
- "If you want the caramel sauce topping to make the doughnuts into monkey bread, melt the leftover cinnamon sugar with just over 3/4 it&#39;s weight of butter in a pan until the sugar has dissolved"
- "Pour over the coated donuts and bake for 25 - 30 minutes"
- "Let cool in the tin for 10 minutes to let the caramel sauce thicken then invert onto a serving plate"
- "It&#39;s probably better to make the balls half the size if doing this, around an inch wide, just because of the sweetness"
