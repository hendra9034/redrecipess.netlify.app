recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Whole wheat flour"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "1 tsp Instant dry yeast or Shirakami dry yeast"
- "1 and 12 tablespoon Honey rice syrup"
- "2 tbsp Dried fruits eg cranberries"
- "135 grams Additivefree unsweetened soy milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Knead together all the ingredients except for the dry yeast. Apparently whole wheat flour bread doesn&#39;t require much kneading. Add the dry yeast last and knead a bit."
- "Allow an hour for the first rise. After it rises, softly punch the dough down to remove the gas, then allow it to rise again for 30 minutes."
- "Remove the dough from the bowl and gently divide into 6 portions and form them into round balls. Cover with a damp cloth and allow the dough to rise for 45 minutes to an hour. (This dough won&#39;t rise too much, so the balls won&#39;t double in size)."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 200 ℃ for 15 minutes. After baking, they&#39;ll still appear small, but they&#39;re very dense, so I think even one roll will leave you quite satisfied."
