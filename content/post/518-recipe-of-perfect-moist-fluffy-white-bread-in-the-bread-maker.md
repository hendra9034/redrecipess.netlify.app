recipeinstructions:
- "Put the ingredients into the bread maker in this order: ◎ ingredients, ● ingredients,○ ingredients then the yeast. Start the dough course."

- "Once baked, take the bread out of the oven on parchment paper and leave to cool. Store them in a plastic bag so that they don&#39;t dry out."
- "They&#39;re so fluffy when just baked."
- "If you don&#39;t press down firmly when scoring the line, it&#39;ll disappear and you will end up with bread that looks like this."
- "They&#39;re so cute and round!"
