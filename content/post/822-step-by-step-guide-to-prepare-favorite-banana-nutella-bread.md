- "Let cool in pan for a maximum of 10 mins, invert onto rack to cool. If left too late in the pan, the bottom of the cake will become soggy."
- "Store, sandwiched in paper towel (to prevent sogginess), tightly wrapped in cling film/tin foil/air tight container (only after it&#39;s completely cooled, else condensation can occur). The bread will last you for two days if stored at room temperature and around one week if refrigerated"
