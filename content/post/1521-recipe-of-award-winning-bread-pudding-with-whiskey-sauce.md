recipeingredient:
- " bread pudding"
- "1 tbsp butter to grease baking dish"
- "1 lb loaf of French or Italian bread"
- "2 cup heavy cream"
- "4 cup whole milk"
- "6 large eggs"
- "1 3/4 cup brown sugar"
- "4 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract"
- "1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "3/4 tsp ground nutmeg"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1/2 cup raisins"
- "1/2 cup chopped pecans"
- " whiskey sauce"
- "2 cup heavy cream"
- "1/2 cup whole milk"
- "1/2 cup granulated sugar"
- "2 1/2 tbsp cornstarch"
- "3/4 cup bourbon or whiskey"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "2 tbsp butter"
- " Whipped cream optional topping"
recipeinstructions:
- "NOTE: Some will want to know if they can cut calories and fat by substituting for the butter, cream, whole milk, eggs. Simple answer, NO. This is a bad-for-you, make-you-moan, decadent, delicious dessert meant to be prepared as written. If you want/need something healthy, this just isn&#39;t for you."
- "Tear the bread into 1-inch pieces and place in a very large bowl."
- "Grease a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with the butter and set aside."
- "Combine the heavy cream, milk, eggs, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk to mix. Stir in the raisins and pecan pieces."
- "Pour the cream mixture over the bread, and stir to combine. The spices tend to stick to the bowl, so be sure to scrape all the spices into the bowl of bread too. Allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for 1 hour so most of the cream mixture is absorbed by the bread."
- "Carefully pour the bread mixture into the buttered baking dish and bake in a 350° F oven until the center of the bread pudding is set, about 1 hour. While it&#39;s baking, prepare the whiskey sauce."
- "In a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream, milk, and sugar."
- "In a measuring cup, whisk together the whiskey and cornstarch. Pour into the pan with the cream mixture and continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat and stir in the butter &amp; the pinch of salt."
- "When the bread pudding is done baking, allow to sit and partially cool, for 10 to 15 minutes. Plate servings, while warm, and top with warm whiskey sauce. It&#39;s also excellent with a shot of whipped cream (aerosol can type) on top of the whiskey sauce! Killer good!!"
