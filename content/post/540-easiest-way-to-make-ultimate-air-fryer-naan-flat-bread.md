recipeingredient:
- "1 cup warm water"
- "2 tbsp maple syrup"
- "1 package active dry yeast 25 oz"
- "3 1/2 cup all purpose white flour"
- "1/4 cup plain greek yogurt"
- "2 tsp salt"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "1 egg"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by activating the yeast. Briefly stir the warm water and maple syrup in a bowl. Sprinkle the yeast on top and give it a short stir. Cover the bowl for 10 minutes. After that, you should see that the yeast has created a foam."
- "Add all remaining ingredients and stir until a slightly sticky dough forms. If you want to add in mix ins, now is the time."
- "Remove the dough from the bowl. Grease the bowl using olive oil and put the dough back. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm spot. You want the dough to at least double in size which can take between 1-4 hours."
- "Turn the dough out onto a floured counter top and divide into 8 equal pieces."
- "Roll each piece out using a rolling pin. If you want something like a naan, roll the pieces to about 6 inches in diameter. If you want something closer to a flat bread, then aim for 8 inches. You should note that a naan will keep for a couple days where a flat bread typically is only good for the day you made it."
- "Set your air fryer to 380 F for 6 minutes. Brush each piece with olive oil and fry for 3 minutes before flipping over."
