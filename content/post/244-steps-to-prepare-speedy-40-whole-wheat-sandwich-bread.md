- "Press the butter to soften a little; set aside. Warm the water-milk mixture with a microwave until reaches 35-40℃ / 95-104 °F. (If the room temperature is high, around 20°C / 68°F.)"

- "Pour the remaining water mixture against powdery places. Mix roughly until it becomes a single mass. Put onto a work surface."
- "Knead for a min, flatten it and put salt on. Knead it for 2-3 mins while stretching and pressing until combined."
- "Hit the dough against the work surface and fold, repeat 30 times. Roll it alternate left and right (1 set), repeat 30 sets. Repeat 30-hitting and 30-rolling alternately for 7-8 mins."
- "Flatten and spread it, put unsalted butter on. Knead well with your hands until combined for around 2-3 mins while pressing and stretching."

- "Punch the air out. Use a rolling pin to roll out one piece into about 15 x 25 cm (5.9 × 9.8 inches) oval or rectangular."
- "Fold it towards the center from left and right to overlap about 1 cm (0.4-inch). Start to roll from one of the shorter ends and roll it up. Pinch the edges to seal well. Repeat with another piece."
- "Place each dough at both ends of a lightly oiled pan with the seam side facing down. Let it rise in a warm place (about 40℃ / 104°F) until the top of the dough reach the height of the loaf pan, about 30-40 mins. Preheat the oven to 220℃ / 428°F."
- "I used my oven to rise the dough until the top of the dough reach the height of the loaf pan. The dough needs to rise a little more, but the oven cannot be used for rising because the oven needs preheating. So I put the pan on the container with warm water to rise until the top of the dough is higher 1 cm (0.4&#39;&#39;) than the height of the pan. Lightly cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying."
- "Spray water lightly (about 3 times). Bake it at 200℃ / 392 °F for 30 mins until golden brown."
- "Drop the pan to prevent shrinkage. Remove the bread from the pan and cool it down on a rack. Done!"
