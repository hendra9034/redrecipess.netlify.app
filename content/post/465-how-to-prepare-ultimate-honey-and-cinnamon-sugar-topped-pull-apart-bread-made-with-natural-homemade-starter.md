recipeingredient:
- "225 grams Bread strong flour from domestically grown wheat"
- "25 grams Cake flour"
- "4 grams Salt"
- "100 grams Homemade natural bread starter"
- "70 ml Milk"
- "70 ml Water"
- "30 grams Honey"
- "5 grams Unsalted butter"
- "5 grams Shortening or vegetable oil"
- "2 tbsp of granulated sugar  11 teaspoon cinnamon Cinnamon sugar for the topping"
- "10 grams Butter for the topping"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the floury ingredients together with a whisk. Measure out the milk and water in a measuring cup. Add the honey to the liquid and mix well to dissolve."
- "Put all the ingredients except for the shortening and butter in a bowl, and mix together until it&#39;s no longer floury. Knead with a bread machine or mixer for 15 minutes. When the dough forms a gluten film (the dough can be stretched out to a thin translucent sheet of gluten) stop kneading."
- "Divide the dough using a pastry cutter into about 10 pieces. Return to the mixer or bread machine, add the butter and shortening, and knead for another 10 minutes. When a gluten film forms again, take the dough out."
- "Form into a ball with a smooth, taut surface. Put the dough in a plastic bag or container, and leave to rise overnight at room temperature, until it&#39;s 2 to 2.5 times its original volume. (The rising time varies depending on the temperature of the room.)"
- "If you leave it in a cool place near a window,for example, it will take about 10 hours. In a warm place it will rise faster. You can adjust the time by putting the dough the refrigerator."
- "The next morning, deflate the dough by folding it, and divide into 16 pieces. Round off each portion into a smooth ball. Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes."
- "After the dough has rested, press down to deflate and round off each piece into a smooth ball again, sealing the edges tightly. LIne up the dough in an oiled square baking pan."
- "Use your oven&#39;s bread-rising setting to conduct the 2nd rising for 1-2 hours at 30°C. Leave the dough to rise until the tops are about 1 cm below the rim of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap or a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel to prevent the dough from drying out."
- "When the dough has finished rising, preheat the oven to 190°C. Mix the sugar and cinnamon powder together to make cinnamon sugar."
- "Melt the butter (over hot water or in the microwave), and brush it evenly over the dough. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the dough generously."
- "Bake for about 18 minutes in a preheated 190°C oven. If it looks like the bread is browning too fast, cover with a piece of foil."
- "When the bread is baked, drop the pan onto your countertop from about a 30 cm height to force the steam out. Take the bread out of the pan and cool on a rack."
- "Here I covered half the loaf with plain granulated sugar, and the other half with cinnamon sugar."
- "To fully enjoy the crunchy sugar top, it&#39;s best to eat this when it&#39;s fresh out of the oven, or just cooled. If you cover the top with plastic, the plastic will stick to the sugar. (See Hints.)"
- "Here I made a version using a whole wheat sponger starter. I made this on a warm day in May; the dough was left to rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature, then for 5-6 hours in the refrigerator, and it was just about right. As a reference."
- "The bread looks like this when pulled apart. Light and silky-smooth and chew. Yummy!"
