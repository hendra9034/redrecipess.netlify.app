recipeingredient:
- "2 lbs ground beef"
- "1/2 onion chopped"
- "1 egg beaten"
- "1 cup dry bread crumbs"
- "1 (1.25 ounce) packet meatloaf seasoning mix"
- "1 cup cubed Cheddar cheese"
- "3 (10 ounce) cans tomato sauce"
- "1 cup white sugar"
- "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce"
- "1 ounce uncooked spaghetti broken into fourths"
- "1/2 carrot cut into 18inch thick slices"
- "1 tablespoon frozen green peas"
- "4 black olives halved optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)."
- "In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, onion, egg, bread crumbs, and meatloaf seasoning. Use your hands to mix until well blended."
- "Divide meat mixture into 8 portions. Mold each portion around a cube of cheese like a meatball. Shape into a point at one end and lengthen the body a bit by rolling between your hands. Place your &#39;&#39;rat&#39;&#39; into a shallow baking dish, and continue with the remaining meat to make a total of 8 rats. Insert pieces of uncooked spaghetti into the rounded end of the rats to make tails."
- "In a medium bowl, stir together the tomato sauce, sugar and Worcestershire sauce. Pour over the rats in the dish and cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil."
- "Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Uncover the dish and continue to bake for another 20 to 30 minutes, basting occasionally with the sauce to glaze the rats."
- "While the rats finish baking, heat the peas and carrots in a small bowl in the microwave for about 15 seconds."
- "Carefully transfer the rats to a serving platter so that their delicate tails don&#39;t fall off. Press peas into the pointy end to make eyes, and insert carrot slices to make ears. If using, press half a black olive onto the pointed end to make a snout. Spoon some of the tomato sauce around them and serve."
- "Serving suggestion: line serving platter with a bed of straw (cooked spaghetti) and place the bloody rats on top! Drip some of the tomato sauce on the spaghetti."
