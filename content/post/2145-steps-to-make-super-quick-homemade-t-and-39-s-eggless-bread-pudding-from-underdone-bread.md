- "Enjoy warm with a little runny honey-water syrup or cold with some fresh cream."
- "Optional: The pudding can also be topped with blueberry marmalade or anything similar, POST BAKING, instead of using muesli. Raisins can also be added to the pudding before baking it. Sugar should be adjusted only after adding milk solids to the pudding as it contains sugar too."
