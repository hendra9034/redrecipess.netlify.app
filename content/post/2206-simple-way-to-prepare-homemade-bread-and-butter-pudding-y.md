- "Add the cinnamon and vanilla extract to the milk and eggs. Mix well."
- "Once that has been made you are able to pour the mixture gradually over the bread. Pour a small amount at a time checking that the mixture is passing through."
- "Once the mixture has all been added, smooth the top layer off for the bread to fuss."
- "Place in oven for 30-35 mins on gas mark 3 on the top shelf."
- "After that time of cooking, lower the gas mark down to gas mark 2 and move the dish to the bottom shelf. Cook for a further 15-20 mins."
- "Once cooked, remove from oven and leave to cool for 5-10 mins before tucking in. Enjoy ;)"
