recipeinstructions:
- "You can use a stand mixer or your hands for this"
- "Using a mixer, put the flour, starch, xanthan gum and salt in the bowl. Attach the dough hook and slowly start to drizzle the milk in on a medium low speed. When half of the milk is in, add the oil then continue slowly adding the milk"
- "When the dough comes together stop adding the milk as you may not need every drop, and let the machine knead the dough for a minute. The dough shouldn&#39;t be sticky"
- "If making the dough by hand, mix the flour, starch, xanthan and salt and form a pile on a work surface"
- "Make a well in the centre, add the oil and 1/4 of the milk and start to mix the flour &amp; milk together"
- "Keep adding the milk in until the dough comes together and you can form a ball of unsticky dough"
- "Halve the dough and on a floured surface, roll it out into 2 equal sized rectangles if you can. It&#39;s best to roll one half out on top of parchment paper for ease to move it later"
- "Put a teaspoon of filling every 1.5 inches or so across the dough then lay the 2nd pasta rectangle (here&#39;s where that parchment is handy) over the top, pressing down around each bump"
- "Use a knife, pizza cutter or ravioli stamp to cut the pasta into shape and let them rest for 20 minutes. Discard any burst ravioli as the filling will seep out during cooking. Re-roll any dough offcuts and repeat until all is used. I get 24 raviolis from this dough recipe"
- "Boil some salted water in a large pan and drop the ravioli in 6 at a time. Boil for 5 minutes or until they float then remove with a slotted spoon and keep warm"
- "Repeat until all are cooked"
- "If using a butter sauce, toss the ravioli into the pan with it until golden on both sides otherwise just fry them gently in some sunflower spread / butter until coloured"
- "To make the pumpkin filling, simply just mix the ingredients together and it&#39;s done"
- "The butter sauces are all made in the same way - melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat until it turns from yellow to golden brown then take off the heat and stir in the other listed ingredients. I like the sweet sauce with the pumpkin filling, the basil sauce with the sweetcorn filling, the mushroom sauce with the pea filling and the mushroom filling with the tomato sauce"
- "To make the minted pea filling, throw everything into a blender and puree until smooth, no defrosting or cooking required"
- "The mushroom sauce for the pea filling is simple too. Fry off the sliced mushrooms in the butter until soft then add a splash of wine and allow to reduce to nothing. Season to taste with the Italian Seasoning, salt &amp; pepper"
- "To make the mushroom filling, melt the butter and oil together in a frying pan and cook the mushrooms and onions together until softened. Add the sliced garlic and thyme and cook a further minute. Drain the liquid away then add the mushroom mixture to a blender with the bread and nutritional yeast (or parmesan cheese). Puree smooth then season to taste"
- "The tomato sauce just needs to be warmed. Put the passata in a pan and when heated through, stir in the basil, coconut milk and season to taste"
- "The sweetcorn filling requires a bit more effort. Melt the 1 tsp butter in a frying pan and saute half of the corn until golden, then set aside. Melt the rest of the butter in the pan and fry off the shallots until almost soft. Add the leftover raw corn, salt and sugar and cook until the corn is bright yellow. Add in the milk and let it reduce down to almost nothing then stir through the thyme. Let this mixture cool then puree it through a blender. Add in the corn that was set aside earlier and season to taste"
- "Each filling and sauce recipe is enough for 24 ravioli, 4 servings of 6 each"

Use my recipe for Slow Cooker Rotisserie Chicken as a base for Cooking your ravioli: Bring water to a boil before adding the ravioli. Add them one at a time so they don&#39;t stick together, then give them a stir. I may tweak a bit next time, but just following the recipe exactly turned out great.

##### Steps to make Vickys Ravioli with Choice of Fillings &amp; Sauces, GF DF EF SF NF:

1. You can use a stand mixer or your hands for this
1. Using a mixer, put the flour, starch, xanthan gum and salt in the bowl. Attach the dough hook and slowly start to drizzle the milk in on a medium low speed. When half of the milk is in, add the oil then continue slowly adding the milk
1. When the dough comes together stop adding the milk as you may not need every drop, and let the machine knead the dough for a minute. The dough shouldn&#39;t be sticky
1. If making the dough by hand, mix the flour, starch, xanthan and salt and form a pile on a work surface
1. Make a well in the centre, add the oil and 1/4 of the milk and start to mix the flour &amp; milk together
1. Keep adding the milk in until the dough comes together and you can form a ball of unsticky dough
1. Halve the dough and on a floured surface, roll it out into 2 equal sized rectangles if you can. It&#39;s best to roll one half out on top of parchment paper for ease to move it later
1. Put a teaspoon of filling every 1.5 inches or so across the dough then lay the 2nd pasta rectangle (here&#39;s where that parchment is handy) over the top, pressing down around each bump
1. Use a knife, pizza cutter or ravioli stamp to cut the pasta into shape and let them rest for 20 minutes. Discard any burst ravioli as the filling will seep out during cooking. Re-roll any dough offcuts and repeat until all is used. I get 24 raviolis from this dough recipe
1. Boil some salted water in a large pan and drop the ravioli in 6 at a time. Boil for 5 minutes or until they float then remove with a slotted spoon and keep warm
1. Repeat until all are cooked
1. If using a butter sauce, toss the ravioli into the pan with it until golden on both sides otherwise just fry them gently in some sunflower spread / butter until coloured
1. To make the pumpkin filling, simply just mix the ingredients together and it&#39;s done
1. The butter sauces are all made in the same way - melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat until it turns from yellow to golden brown then take off the heat and stir in the other listed ingredients. I like the sweet sauce with the pumpkin filling, the basil sauce with the sweetcorn filling, the mushroom sauce with the pea filling and the mushroom filling with the tomato sauce
1. To make the minted pea filling, throw everything into a blender and puree until smooth, no defrosting or cooking required
1. The mushroom sauce for the pea filling is simple too. Fry off the sliced mushrooms in the butter until soft then add a splash of wine and allow to reduce to nothing. Season to taste with the Italian Seasoning, salt &amp; pepper
1. To make the mushroom filling, melt the butter and oil together in a frying pan and cook the mushrooms and onions together until softened. Add the sliced garlic and thyme and cook a further minute. Drain the liquid away then add the mushroom mixture to a blender with the bread and nutritional yeast (or parmesan cheese). Puree smooth then season to taste
1. The tomato sauce just needs to be warmed. Put the passata in a pan and when heated through, stir in the basil, coconut milk and season to taste
1. The sweetcorn filling requires a bit more effort. Melt the 1 tsp butter in a frying pan and saute half of the corn until golden, then set aside. Melt the rest of the butter in the pan and fry off the shallots until almost soft. Add the leftover raw corn, salt and sugar and cook until the corn is bright yellow. Add in the milk and let it reduce down to almost nothing then stir through the thyme. Let this mixture cool then puree it through a blender. Add in the corn that was set aside earlier and season to taste
1. Each filling and sauce recipe is enough for 24 ravioli, 4 servings of 6 each


Add them one at a time so they don&#39;t stick together, then give them a stir. I may tweak a bit next time, but just following the recipe exactly turned out great.
