recipeingredient:
- "160 grams Whole wheat flour superfine"
- "120 grams Bread strong flour"
- "20 grams Sugar roasted sugar"
- "4 grams Natural Salt"
- "3 grams Dry yeast"
- "1 tbsp Olive oil"
- "180 ml Water"
- "30 grams Raisins"

recipeinstructions:
- "Plump up the raisins in boiling water, drain and pat dry with paper towels. If the raisins are coated with oil, wash it off."
- "Put all the ingredients except the ones marked ■ in the bread machine, and start the dough-only program!"
- "Since there are a lot of ■ dried fruits, add them to the dough when the &#39;mix-in&#39; signal sounds (with about 45 minutes left in the program). When the 1st rising is done, test the dough with your finger."
- "The finger test: press a moistened finger into the dough and pull it out slowly. If the hole made with the finger remains it&#39;s good! If the hole fills back in, it has to rise some more."
- "Take the dough out onto a floured work surface, divide into 12 pieces (45-50 g each) and round off each piece. Cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, and rest for 10 minutes."
- "Dust the dough lightly, turn over, deflate and round off with a smooth surface on top. Line up on a baking sheet in pairs, each pair of rolls touching each other."
- "Cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, and leave to rise (2nd rising) at around 30°C for 40 to 50 minutes (at room temperature if in the summer). If a moistened finger gently pressed in the dough leaves a mark, it&#39;s done rising."
- "Mist with water, (optionally dust with bread flour) and preheat the oven to 200°C. Lower the temperature to 180°C and bake for 10 to 12 minutes - done! They look like this inside."
- "I used this &#34;Super Fine Hard&#34; whole wheat flour."
- "This version has 50% whole wheat flour (140 g finely ground)  + 140 g bread flour. This really has the flavor of whole wheat, and the more you chew the better it tastes."
- "This version has 64% whole wheat flour (160g superfine whole wheat + 20 g graham flour) + 100 g domestic bread flour. This version is very light!"
- "For the version in Step 11: Try baking six rolls stuck together, or slashing the tops. If you use domestic bread flour, use 170 ml of water."
- "This version has 82% whole wheat flour (210 g superfine whole wheat flour + 20 g graham flour) + 50 g bread flour 30 g each of walnuts and raisins = densely textured and delicious."
