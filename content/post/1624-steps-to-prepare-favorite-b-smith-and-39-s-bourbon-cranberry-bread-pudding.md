recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Cut a piece of parchment paper to a length of 26 inches. Fold in thirds lengthwise so that it becomes 4 1/2 inches wide. Lightly butter the paper and fit it inside the pan along all four sides, buttered side facing in; make sure at least 1 1/2 inches extend beyond the top of the pan rim. Place loaf pan on a baking pan and set aside"
- "In a medium bowl and using an electric beater, beat 2 eggs and 1 yolk with 2/3 cup granulated sugar until very thick and pale. In a large pan over medium heat, combine 2 cups milk, heavy cream, 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, 4 teaspoons vanilla, 1 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cook, stirring occasionally, just until bubbles form around edge of pan. Remove from heat. Gradually stir milk-cream mixture, a tablespoon at a time, into beaten eggs. Then, gradually return entire mixture to the pan."
- "Add bread, 1/2 cup cranberries, and pecans to milk-cream-egg mixture and gently stir to mix, making sure all bread is soaked. Transfer to prepared loaf pan and bake until set and a knife inserted into center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool. Remove from pan to cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve, or up to 1 day."
- "Meanwhile, in a medium bowl and using an electric beater, beat together 4 eggs, maple syrup, bourbon, and remaining vanilla. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm remaining milk just until bubbles form around edge of pan; cool slightly. Add bourbon mixture. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes (do not allow mixture to boil). Strain into a bowl and stir to cool slightly. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve, or up to 1 day."
- "In a medium pan, bring 3/4 cup water and remaining cranberries and sugar to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cook until berries just begin to pop. Let cool; then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve, or up to 1 day."
- "Cut reserved bread pudding into 8 slices. Stir remaining eggs and cinnamon together in a pie plate. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. Working with 1 slice at a time, dip bread pudding into egg mixture. Cook, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining slices. To serve, spoon reserved bourbon custard on a platter. Place bread pudding slices on custard and top with reserved cranberry sauce. Sprinkle with confectioners&#39; sugar."
