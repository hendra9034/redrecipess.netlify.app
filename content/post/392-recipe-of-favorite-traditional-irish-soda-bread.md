recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 425 degrees."

You invoke Gods blessing by saying, &#34;In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Amen&#34; as you score the bread. As well, the four corners are pricked with with a knife to release the fairies. This is to keep it from being cursed."
- "Glaze the top of the loaf with the leftover buttermilk/egg mixture and sprinkle the rolled oats on the top of the loaf."
- "Bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes and then turn the oven down to 400 degrees and bake for 30 minutes more. When done, the loaf should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom."
