recipeinstructions:
- "Coat an oven-safe container with margarine or butter. Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F. if using a gas oven, then 170°C ~180°C (340°F~350°F). You can also use a few small ramekins if you wish."

- "Bake for 20 minutes. If you like it a little crispier, then let it bake a little longer."
- "If you don&#39;t have any heavy cream, you can just use more milk. You can change the liqueur to vanilla essence if you prefer. You can also use baguettes, multi grain bread, or white bread as not just the crusts will get hard on these breads."
