recipeingredient:
- "3 1/2 cups Whole wheat flour"
- "2 1/2 tsp instant yeast"
- "1 1/4 tsp salt"
- "1/4 cup honey"
- "1/4 cup vegetable oil"
- "1-1/8 cups lukewarm whole milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a mixing bowl, combine, stir and knead until the dough starts to leave the sides of the bowl. For easiest kneading let the dough rest for 20-30 minutes to absorb the liquid. Adjust it&#39;s consistency with flour or water as needed."
- "Transfer dough to lightly greased bowl and let rise until doubled, about 1-2 hours."
- "Lightly oil your work surface, knead and shape it to an 8&#34;log, place it on a greased 8 1/2&#34; x 4 1/2&#34;loaf pan. Cover it loosely with plastic wrap or clean towel, and let it rise until the center has crowned about 1&#34; above the rim of the pan."
- "Towards the end of rising time, preheat the oven to 180°C. Bake the bread for 35-40 minutes, tenting it with aluminum foil after 20 minutes to avoid over browning."
- "Remove the bread from oven and turn it out of the pan. Rub the crust with butter, which will make a soft and flavorful crust. Cool completely before slicing or storing."
