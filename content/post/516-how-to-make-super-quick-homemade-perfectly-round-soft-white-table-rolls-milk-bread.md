recipeingredient:
- "240 grams Strong bread flour"
- "60 grams Cake flour"
- "20 grams Sugar"
- "5 grams Salt"
- "6 grams Dry yeast"
- "230 grams Milk"
- "20 grams Shortening"
- "1 dash Rice flour for finishing or joshinko or bread flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the bread dough by mixing all of the ingredients except the shortening and rice flour, and allow it to rise until it doubles in size."
- "Add the shortening when a slightly glutinous film forms on the surface of the dough (At this point, you should be able to see through the dough if you stretch it out thinly enough)."
- "If you use a bread machine, add all the ingredients except the shortening in the baking cake, and start kneading. Then add the shortening after 10 minutes or so."
- "Divide the dough into 10 portions, gently press down on the dough to deflate, and roll them into balls. Allow them to rest for 15 minutes."
- "Gently press down on the dough to deflate, and roll them into balls again. (Place them sealed ends down.)"
- "Allow them to rise (for at least 30 minutes) until they increase to 1.5 times their original sizes. (Proof the dough at 40℃ using the proofing function of the oven. In summer, proof the dough at room temperature.)"
- "Sprinkle with rice flour using a tea strainer. Bake in a preheated oven to 160℃ for 12-13 minutes. (They are done when the bottoms of the rolls are lightly browned.)"
- "If you&#39;d like to serve these as snacks, shake off the excess rice flour and sprinkle with a generous amount of powdered sugar."
- "Make a slit in a roll, but not all the way through, to make a sandwich for breakfast."
- "They also make good snacks when they&#39;re cut in half and topped with a generous amount of maple syrup, honey or jam."
- "They will have a more moist and chewy texture the next day, but if you wrap them in cling film, and microwave for about 20 seconds (500 W), they will feel like they&#39;re freshly baked again."
- "They are also delicious if you brush on an egg wash and bake for 12-15 minutes at 180℃."
- "Or break up a chocolate bar, roll it up in the dough, and drizzle with melted chocolate to finish."
- "The best milk temperature for the dough: About 30℃ for spring and autumn. About 10℃ for summer, and about 45℃ for winter."
