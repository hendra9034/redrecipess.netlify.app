- "1 cup all purpose flour"
- "1 tbsp granulated sugar"
- "3 tbsp powdered sugar"

- "1 +1/4 tbsp active dry yeast"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/2 cup vegetable oil"

- "1/2 tsp cinnamon powder"
- "2-3 tbsp roughly chopped walnuts"
- "for sugar syrup "
- "1/2 cup water"
- "1/2 cup sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a big mixing bowl combine whole wheat flour, all purpose flour, salt and powdered sugar and mix well. Now make a small depression (round) in the centre and pour warm water in it. Add granulated sugar and yeast to it. Leave it for 5 minutes. Now add the oil and vanilla extract to the yeast and make a slurry."
- "Now using your hands mix the yeast with the flour mixture and knead a dough. Transfer the dough on a lightly floured work surface and knead for 4-5 minutes until the dough becomes soft and smooth. Then make a round ball of the dough. Put the dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover it with a cloth and let it rise for about 1- 1.5 hours or until it has almost doubled in volume."
- "Meanwhile prepare the filling. Combine all the ingredients listed in filling section(except cinnamon powder and walnuts) in a microwave safe bowl and microwave on medium-high for one minute and then take it out and using a whisk mix well. Microwave again for a minute, take it out and mix well."
- "Let the chocolate sauce cool and then keep it refrigerated until required. When the dough has doubled in volume knock it down with a fist and on a floured surface roll it into a rectangle with 1/2 cm thickness."
- "Now spread half of the chocolate mixture and spread evenly on the rolled dough leaving 1&#34; border on each side. Sprinkle cinnamon powder evenly over the chocolate spread followed by chopped walnuts. Roll the dough into a tight log."
- "Take a sharp knife and cut the log lengthwise. Then twist each piece and make an X as a braid. Then seal each end properly by pinching it under the braid. Lift the log gently and carefully and put it into a lined 9&#34; loaf pan and cover it with a samp cloth and keep it in a warm place to let rise until it doubles in volume."
- "Preheat the oven at 180°c. Brush the loaf with almond milk. Bake for about 30-40 minutes or until the bread gets a beautiful golden brown colour. Take it out and let it cool. Meanwhile prepare the sugar syrup. For the syrup boil sugar and water in a sauce pan until the sugar dissolves completely. Brush the Babka with this syrup generously or pour a little at a time all over the bread and let it cool."
- "Slice it and drizzle some chocolate sauce over it and serve warm. Notes : Always serve the bread warm. Don&#39;t skip the sugar syrup it keeps the bread soft and moist. Babka can be stored in the refrigerator wrapped in a foil up to 4 days. You can even make sweet French toasts using Babka. It tastes amazing. You can try different nuts and fruits as a filling."
