recipeingredient:
- "2 cups all purpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon baking powder"
- "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/2 cup butter room temperature"
- "3/4 cup light brown sugar"
- "2 eggs"
- "3 large very ripe bananas dont mash until ready to mix"
- "1 tablespoon vanilla extract"
- "1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "1/2 cup chopped walnuts"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350° &amp; spray a glass 9×5 loaf pan with non stick spray."
- "In a large bowl sift together all the dry ingredients except walnuts (flour, salt, baking powder, and cocoa.) I sifted mine 3 times. This will ensure all your ingredients mix well and you won&#39;t overwork the batter."
- "In a separate bowl use a hand mixer to blend all the wet ingredients until smooth (eggs, butter, vanilla, and brown sugar.) Set aside and mash your bananas with a fork (a few chunks are ok.) Once mashed combine bananas with the wet ingredients. Add the walnuts and give a quick stir."
- "Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet. I recommend doing this in batches. I did 4 batches, gently folding each with a spatula. Stir just enough to combine. You don&#39;t want to overwork the batter because it will result in a dense bread. Pour into prepared dish and place on center rack in oven."
- "Bake at 350° for about an hour. Check for doneness by inserting a small knife or a wooden skewer into the center. It&#39;s done if it comes out clean. Ovens vary so cooking time may be a little different."
- "Remove from oven and let cool in pan for 30 minutes. After that remove from pan and cool for another hour on a rack."
