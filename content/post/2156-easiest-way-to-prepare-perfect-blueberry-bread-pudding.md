- "Bake for 20 minutes. If you like it a little crispier, then let it bake a little longer."
- "If you don&#39;t have any heavy cream, you can just use more milk. You can change the liqueur to vanilla essence if you prefer. You can also use baguettes, multi grain bread, or white bread as not just the crusts will get hard on these breads."
