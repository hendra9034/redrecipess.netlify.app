recipeinstructions:
- "Cube all the cheeses and place them in a large bowl. The jarlsberg is the hard base cheese and should be diced or shredded as it takes the longest of the three to fully melt. The greuyre and the fontina will melt the fastest so they can be cut slightly larger."
- "Sprinkle corn starch over the bowl and mix it together until all the cheese is coated evenly."
- "Set up a nonstick pan on medium heat with about half of the apple cider vinegar. Slowly add the cheese and the rest of the cider, then mix everything in until fully melted. If the mix is too liquidy, corn starch can be added to it; and if the consistency is too thick, more apple cider can be added to loosen it."
