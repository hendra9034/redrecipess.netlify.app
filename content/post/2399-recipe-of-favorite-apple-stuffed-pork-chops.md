- "Take all that onion gravy in the pan and puree until smooth. Make sure you scrap in any brown bits and pieces. Put your gravy back into the pan to reduce over low to medium heat until you like the consistency add salt and pepper to taste"
- "Pour that grave on top and serve with potatoes. You can bake the potatoes at 350 too just put em in for about 20 min before the chops."
