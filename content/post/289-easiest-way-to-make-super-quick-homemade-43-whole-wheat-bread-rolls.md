recipeingredient:
- "160 grams Bread strong flour"
- "100 grams Whole wheat flour superfine grind"
- "20 grams Whole wheat flour graham flour"
- "8 grams Sugar roasted sugar"
- "4 grams Natural salt"
- "4 grams Dry yeast"
- "1 tbsp Olive oil"
- "180 to 190 ml Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the ingredients in a bread machine in the listed order. Add the dry yeast into the yeast compartment, and start the &#34;dough-only&#34; program! (In the summer knead the dough with the lid open.)"
- "After the 1st rising is complete, take the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide it into 8 pieces (each piece should weigh about 60g)."
- "Round off each piece of dough, trying not to touch the cut edges. Cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel and leave to rest for 10 minutes."
- "Press the dough down with your palms to deflate. Dust with flour and turn them over, and form into thin rolls as shown in the photo."
- "Cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, and leave to rise again (2nd rising) - about 40 minutes at 30 to 35°C. During the summer you can do this at room temperature!"
- "When the rolls have doubled in volume they&#39;re ready to bake! Start preheating the oven about 5 to 10 minutes before the dough has finished rising."
- "Mist the dough with water, optionally dust with flour, and slash the tops with a sharp knife."
- "Bake at 190 °C for 12 minutes and they&#39;re done! If you turn the baking sheet around 3 minutes before the end of the baking time, there won&#39;t be any unevenness in the finish."
- "Light and airy. The more you chew on these, the more you can taste the delicious flour."
- "If your timing is off after kneading the dough, you can delay the rise and adjust your schedule a bit by putting the dough in the vegetable compartment of your refrigerator."
- "This time, after I finished kneading the dough, I rounded the dough off, put it in an oiled bowl, covered the bowl with plastic and left it in the vegetable compartment for its 1st rising."
- "2 and a half hours later, test the dough with a finger. If the hole it makes remains, it&#39;s good to go. Proceed from Step 2 above."
- "Be sure to always test the rise with your finger! Poke in a moistened finger, and take it out slowly. If the hole remains the dough has risen enough. If the hole fills back in it needs more time."
- "All kinds of sandwiches . Ham + coleslaw + tomato; scrambled eggs + spinach + cheese; sautéed carrots."
- "Try using 15 g of honey dissolved in the water instead of the sguar. Please weigh the water with the honey in it. The honey version of this bread is even lighter!"
